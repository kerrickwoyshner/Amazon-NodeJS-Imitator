# Bamazon-Node-App
A take on the classic bargain-hunter using the command line in Node.js and databases in MySQL and Sequel Pro.

1.  Pull the following repo into your text editor and run it using Node.js in the bash/terminal window of your choice.
2.  Each folder has a different tier of responsibility over the Bamazon application, starting at the Customer level where you can purchase products, then the Manager level where you can add products to the inventory and see products in low supply, and finally the Supervisor level where you can generate reports on each product department's performance and add nonexisting departments to the Bamazon application.

Toggle inside each folder to see a more comprehensive README.md and instructions for how to run the application on your own device.  

If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me! I hope you enjoy using this application as much as I enjoyed building it :)
